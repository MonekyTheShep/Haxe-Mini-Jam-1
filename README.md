**Snakey** is a [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/) project built entirely from scratch. In this game, you control a snake that eats apples.\
Each apple consumed causes the snake to grow longer and increments the playerâ€™s score by `1`.

The **limitation**, "Turn Based" was implemented here in the movement of the snake. Snake turns... turn based... based on snake.
